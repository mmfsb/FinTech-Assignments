# Affirm

## Overview and Origin

* Affirm was established in 2012 by Max Levchin (co-founder of PayPal), Nathan Gettings (founder of ReboteX), Jeffrey Kaditz (founder of Q Bio), and Alex Rampell (general partner at Andreessen Horowitz).

* The company's idea came about as part of the initial portfolio of startup studio HVF (Hard, Valuable, Fun). HVF is an umbrella organization for all of Levchin's data-focused undertakings, including Affirm, Yelp, Glow, and HM Bradley.

* Levchin has stated that he founded Affirm to bring people a better, more flexible, and transparent way to pay. He wanted to find a way that didn't include uncertainty, hidden fees, or endless payments.

* According to Crunchbase, Affirm has raised a total of $1.5 billion across nine rounds of venture capital funding. The fintech company has raised over $1 billion before its IPO, which includes a $500 million Series G in September of 2020, a $300 million Series F in April of 2019, and a $200 million Series E in December 2017. Affirm also raised more than $400 million in earlier equity rounds and a $100 million debt line in late 2016.


## Business Activities:

* Affirm allows users to take out microloans at the point of sale (POS) with participating merchants and aims to provide a quick, undisguised, and more inclusive lending alternative to credit cards. Affirm uses its own credit scoring system, bypassing the FICO monopoly - and it eschews late fees, deferred interest, and punitive rates.

* There is no physical credit card involved when paying through Affirm; however, consumers receive a digital credit card post-approval to continue through check-out. An increased layer of protection against fraud or identity theft is provided because of this.  

* While a myriad of banks and credit card companies make money through late fees and other penalties, consumer lending startup Affirm takes an alternate path. The company targets consumers with limited access to credit and earns profits when customers pay back their loans.
Affirm distinguishes itself from credit cards by rejecting late fees, hidden fees, and compound interestâ€” it, however, does charge interest.

* Affirm only asks users for five pieces of information to make a credit decision. They are also very transparent, and consumers know upfront what the total purchase cost will be, including the full interest amount.
It doesn't charge any late penalty, or annual fees, which could add to the principal balance, and therefore complicate interest costs.  Unlike credit cards, Affirm's app and POS loans are not a revolving line of credit. Every credit application at Affirm is considered a separate, close-ended transaction that does not depend on existing credit lines with the borrower.

* Through their advanced technology and analytics that look beyond traditional FICO scores, Affirm can serve a much broader population than other lenders.


## Landscape:

* Affirm is a part of the payments domain of FinTech - specifically the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) point of sale (POS) microloan.

* Payment innovations in fintech have multiple components. These are mobile payments, contactless payments, mobile wallets, smart speaker systems, identity verification technologies, AI, and machine learning for security.

* Based on figures from 2020, the most significant trend in payment innovations is the rise of mobile payments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when more transactions shifted online. But it's not just online purchasing that is covered by mobile payments.

* Other significant companies in the BNPL POS domain include AfterPay, Klarna, Simpl (India), Plays (Canada), Ovo PayLater (Indonesia), Sezzle, PayBright (Canada), LazyPay (India), zipPay (Australia), Uplift (Canada), and Splitit.  AfterPay has made notable partnerships with retailers like FinishLine and has grown over 125% customers. Splitit allows consumers to leverage their existing credit cards through its installment program without added fees or interest. Instead of seeing a $150 balance due on your AMEX statement for a recent purchase, you can instead see $50 installments.

## Results

* Affirm allows companies to cut costs but not loan volume. They have provided customized financing programs, which has resulted in a positive net percent increase in gross profit annually. Affirm achieved this goal through increasing loan volume and replacing high-cost plans with attractive payment terms. This way, the customer is satisfied, and also, the increased sales provide merchants more money to hire more employees or invest in their products.

* Affirm is doing relatively well, as they have contracts with various merchants, including Walmart, Peloton, Apple, and Amazon. They have also included retailers associated with travel and hotels (Expedia, Priceline, Delta Vacations), the auto industry (Advanced Auto Parts, 10 Second Racing LLC, J&P Cyles), and the fitness industry (Dick's Sporting Goods, Adidas, Nike) to name a few.

## Recommendations

* Affirm can work on allowing consumers to refinance an existing loan for a better rate. Because Affirm already has its own algorithm for providing creditworthiness for consumers, they can create their own credit reporting system based on their digital footprint. Maybe they can one day arrange a point and reward system for customers who do not miss payments or as a way to promote customer loyalty.
